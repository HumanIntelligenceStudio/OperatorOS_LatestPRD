## Conclusion

Success depends on understanding timing, resource management, and adapting to different matchups. The deck excels against unprepared opponents and can steal games through unexpected victory conditions.

**Win Rate Expectations:**
- Against casual players: 70-80%
- Against competitive players: 45-55%
- In tournament settings: 40-50%

The deck serves as an excellent budget option and meta disruptor, capable of taking games off top-tier strategies through careful piloting and opponent unfamiliarity.
