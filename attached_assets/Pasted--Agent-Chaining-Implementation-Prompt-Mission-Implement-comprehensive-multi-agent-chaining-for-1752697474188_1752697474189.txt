# Agent Chaining Implementation Prompt

## Mission: Implement comprehensive multi-agent chaining for holistic responses

Transform the existing OperatorOS agent architecture to automatically break down user queries into multiple perspectives and chain the appropriate agents to deliver the most comprehensive answer possible.

## Core Implementation Requirements

### 1. **Create Query Analysis Engine**
Build a new `query_analyzer.py` that:
```python
def analyze_user_query(user_input: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze user query to identify what types of expertise are needed
    
    Returns:
    {
        "primary_domain": "business",
        "required_perspectives": ["financial", "strategic", "operational", "risk"],
        "complexity_level": "high",
        "agent_chain": ["CFO", "CSA", "COO", "CRO"],
        "synthesis_needed": True
    }
    """
```

### 2. **Build Agent Chain Orchestrator**
Create `agent_chain_orchestrator.py` that:
- **Sequences agents** based on query analysis
- **Passes context** between agents in the chain
- **Aggregates responses** from multiple agents
- **Synthesizes final answer** with all perspectives
- **Routes each agent** to optimal LLM automatically

### 3. **Enhance Expert Factory for Multi-Domain**
Extend `expert_factory.py` to:
- **Generate multiple experts** for complex queries
- **Create expert teams** on-demand (e.g., "divorce team" = lawyer + financial advisor + therapist)
- **Route expert teams** to optimal LLMs based on specialization
- **Chain expert responses** for comprehensive solutions

### 4. **Implement Response Synthesis Engine**
Create `response_synthesizer.py` that:
```python
def synthesize_agent_responses(agent_responses: List[AgentResponse]) -> str:
    """
    Combine multiple agent perspectives into one comprehensive answer
    
    Features:
    - Identify overlapping insights
    - Highlight conflicting viewpoints
    - Create action-oriented synthesis
    - Maintain each agent's unique perspective
    """
```

### 5. **Create Multi-Agent Endpoint**
Add to `main.py`:
```python
@app.route('/api/comprehensive-analysis', methods=['POST'])
def comprehensive_analysis():
    """
    New endpoint that automatically chains relevant agents
    for the most comprehensive response possible
    """
    user_query = request.json.get('query')
    
    # Analyze what expertise is needed
    analysis = query_analyzer.analyze_user_query(user_query)
    
    # Chain appropriate agents
    responses = agent_chain_orchestrator.process_chain(
        query=user_query,
        agent_chain=analysis['agent_chain']
    )
    
    # Synthesize comprehensive answer
    final_response = response_synthesizer.synthesize_agent_responses(responses)
    
    return jsonify({
        "comprehensive_answer": final_response,
        "perspectives_included": analysis['required_perspectives'],
        "agents_consulted": analysis['agent_chain'],
        "confidence_score": calculate_confidence(responses)
    })
```

### 6. **Update Frontend for Multi-Agent Display**
Modify the chat interface to:
- **Show agent thinking process** ("Consulting CFO for financial analysis...")
- **Display multiple perspectives** in expandable sections
- **Highlight synthesis** as the main answer
- **Show confidence scores** for each perspective

### 7. **Implement Smart Agent Selection**
Create logic that automatically determines optimal agent chains:

```python
# Example Query: "Should I quit my job to start a business?"
AUTO_CHAIN = [
    "CFO",      # Financial analysis of current vs projected income
    "CSA",      # Strategic analysis of market opportunity  
    "COO",      # Operational planning for business launch
    "Personal_Coach",  # Personal readiness and risk tolerance
    "SYNTHESIZER"      # Combine all perspectives
]

# Example Query: "I need help with my divorce"
AUTO_CHAIN = [
    "Legal_Expert",     # Legal rights and process
    "Financial_Advisor", # Asset division and financial planning
    "Therapist",        # Emotional support and coping
    "Child_Psychologist", # If children involved
    "SYNTHESIZER"       # Holistic divorce strategy
]
```

### 8. **Add Context Passing Between Agents**
Implement context awareness where:
- **Agent 2 sees Agent 1's response** before providing their perspective
- **Final agent has full context** from all previous agents
- **Synthesis agent** combines all perspectives intelligently
- **User context** is maintained throughout the chain

### 9. **Create Confidence & Quality Scoring**
Add quality assessment that:
- **Scores each agent response** for relevance and completeness
- **Identifies knowledge gaps** that need additional expertise
- **Triggers additional agents** if confidence is low
- **Provides transparency** about answer quality

### 10. **Implement Dynamic Chain Adjustment**
Build adaptive logic that:
- **Adjusts agent chain** based on initial responses
- **Adds specialists** if specific expertise is needed
- **Skips redundant agents** if perspectives overlap
- **Optimizes for speed vs comprehensiveness** based on user preference

## Integration Points

### Use Existing Systems:
- ‚úÖ **Expert Factory** - For dynamic expert generation
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent Router** - For optimal LLM selection per agent
- ‚úÖ **Multi-LLM Provider** - For diverse AI capabilities
- ‚úÖ **Agent Types** - Extend current CFO, CSA, etc.

### New Components Needed:
- üÜï **Query Analyzer** - Break down user needs
- üÜï **Chain Orchestrator** - Manage agent sequences
- üÜï **Response Synthesizer** - Combine perspectives
- üÜï **Context Manager** - Pass information between agents

## Expected Outcome

**Before:** Single agent response
"Here's some business advice..."

**After:** Comprehensive multi-agent analysis
```

## Implementation Priority
1. **Query Analyzer** - Core logic for understanding user needs
2. **Chain Orchestrator** - Agent sequencing and coordination  
3. **Response Synthesizer** - Combine multiple perspectives
4. **Frontend Updates** - Show multi-agent process to user
5. **Advanced Features** - Confidence scoring, dynamic adjustment

This transforms OperatorOS from single-agent responses to comprehensive multi-expert analysis for any user query.
